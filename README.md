## District Data Lab Spring Research Lab  Week 1 Proposals

### Proposal #1 Horse racing dataset.  

The dataset is derieved from tips that tipsters provided to bettors.  
Tipsters are people that give bettors their best guess aka tip on how to place a bet on a horse race.  
This dataset could be used to predict horse races.


##### Topic:
Interesting Dataset;  

##### Proposal/Yellowbrick:
Classification tutorial with an unbalanced data set  

##### Notes:
This dataset is unbalanced.  Given that horse racing is a game of chance, you would expect an unbalanced target.  

#### Other:
1.  Consists of 380k tips
2.  Current features include odds, track, bet-type, horse name, and result
3.  Other features could be added to put together a successful machine learning model such as tempature, humidty, and precipitation.


### Russian Trolls: Proposal #2

This dataset released by NBC on Feb. 14 contains 200K tweets from Russian Trolls:

#### Topic:
Interesting Dataset; Beginner Tutorial

#### Proposal:  
1.  Create a beginner tutorial on topic modeling  
2.  Tutorial on predicting number of retweets(Caveats: Very hard to predict)

#### Yellowbrick:  
1.  Proposal #1 :Use FreqDist to show most frequent words; Use t-SNE to visualize clustering  
2.  Proposal #2: Use Regression visualizers
